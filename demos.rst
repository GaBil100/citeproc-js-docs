The |citeproc-js| CSL processor is the citation formatting engine
behind Zotero, Mendeley, Juris-M, and numerous other projects.  As a
JavaScript module, it can be run client-side in any of the leading
browsers, opening a path to streamlined publication of properly cited
academic works.

The demo pages in this section provide worked examples of a
`Standalone Bibliography <deployments.html>`_ and of a page with
support for `Dynamic Editing <dynamic-editing.html>`_ of citations, as
starting points for integration projects.

Go forth, and make publishing direct-to-the-Web as elegant and
accountable as it is easy to do.
